This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Starting Out

This is a relatively simple app built using React. To preview this app clone this project to your local machine. Open this project in your 
terminal and install all dependencies using `npm install`. Once all dependencies are finished installing you can start the app using `npm start`.
Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your terminal to preview the app. Please note, this app is front end only. It still needs to be linked with a database to save current status, 
once away from the page all current progress will be lost.
